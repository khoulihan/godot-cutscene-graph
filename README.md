# Cutscene Graph Editor

This is a plugin for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) to create and edit graphs of cutscenes and dialogue resources.


## Installation

Download the source and move/copy the contents of the addons directory to the addons directory of your Godot project.

This plugin is still very much a work in progress, so more documentation will follow when it is more fully developed.
